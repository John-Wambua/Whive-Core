/* Seed OpenSSL PRNG with additional entropy data */
void RandAddSeed();
=======
/**
 * Overall design of the RNG and entropy sources.
 *
 * We maintain a single global 256-bit RNG state for all high-quality randomness.
 * The following (classes of) functions interact with that state by mixing in new
 * entropy, and optionally extracting random output from it:
 *
 * - The GetRand*() class of functions, as well as construction of FastRandomContext objects,
 *   perform 'fast' seeding, consisting of mixing in:
 *   - A stack pointer (indirectly committing to calling thread and call stack)
 *   - A high-precision timestamp (rdtsc when available, c++ high_resolution_clock otherwise)
 *   - 64 bits from the hardware RNG (rdrand) when available.
 *   These entropy sources are very fast, and only designed to protect against situations
 *   where a VM state restore/copy results in multiple systems with the same randomness.
 *   FastRandomContext on the other hand does not protect against this once created, but
 *   is even faster (and acceptable to use inside tight loops).
 *
 * - The GetStrongRand*() class of function perform 'slow' seeding, including everything
 *   that fast seeding includes, but additionally:
 *   - OS entropy (/dev/urandom, getrandom(), ...). The application will terminate if
 *     this entropy source fails.
 *   - Bytes from OpenSSL's RNG (which itself may be seeded from various sources)
 *   - Another high-precision timestamp (indirectly committing to a benchmark of all the
 *     previous sources).
 *   These entropy sources are slower, but designed to make sure the RNG state contains
 *   fresh data that is unpredictable to attackers.
 *
 * - RandAddSeedSleep() seeds everything that fast seeding includes, but additionally:
 *   - A high-precision timestamp before and after sleeping 1ms.
 *   - (On Windows) Once every 10 minutes, performance monitoring data from the OS.
 -   - Once every minute, strengthen the entropy for 10 ms using repeated SHA512.
 *   These just exploit the fact the system is idle to improve the quality of the RNG
 *   slightly.
 *
 * On first use of the RNG (regardless of what function is called first), all entropy
 * sources used in the 'slow' seeder are included, but also:
 * - 256 bits from the hardware RNG (rdseed or rdrand) when available.
 * - (On Windows) Performance monitoring data from the OS.
 * - (On Windows) Through OpenSSL, the screen contents.
 * - Strengthen the entropy for 100 ms using repeated SHA512.
 *
 * When mixing in new entropy, H = SHA512(entropy || old_rng_state) is computed, and
 * (up to) the first 32 bytes of H are produced as output, while the last 32 bytes
 * become the new RNG state.
